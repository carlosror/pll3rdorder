## Motivation

I had always wanted a tool that made the iterative and laborious PLL design process **much** faster and efficient so that designers could quickly see how changing a loop parameter would impact the various figures of merit. I also wanted to make it freely available and maybe even have it run in the browser

I understood PLLs a lot better after reading Dean Banerjee's [PLL Performance Simulation and Design Handbook](http://www.ti.com/tool/pll_book), in its fourth edition at the time. He explains things very elegantly in his book, and diligently goes through the process of arranging the transfer functions, with all those s<sup>2</sup>, s<sup>3</sup>, and s<sup>4</sup> terms, in a way that makes it intuitive to see what is going on.

In 2011 I took MIT OCW's [MIT 6.00 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/) by professors Eric Grimson and John Guttag, which uses [Python](http://www.python.org) as a vehicle to introduce students to computer science (or reacquaint former ones: my previous programming course had been in 1993). At once fun and excruciating, I *immensely* enjoyed MIT 6.00. In 2012, I took Udacity's [CS253 - Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253), taught by Steve Huffman, one of [Reddit's](https://www.reddit.com/) founders. I didn't get to the build-your-own-blog part, but the course did introduce me to using Python for web development in [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).

I used those three building blocks (Banerjee's book, MIT's 6.00, and Udacity's CS253) along with other modules to deliver this app.

## Technologies

**Backend**: Python and Python modules numpy, xlrd, and xlwt, Google App Engine, Jinja2 templating engine

**Frontend**: HTML5(HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Hint.css for tooltips, Google Charts

Generally speaking, the computations are done in the backend using Python and numpy, then Jinja2 populates the templates in the frontend with the results. The only computations that are done in the frontend are the phase error and jitter.

## Features

Clicking on that "Evaluate PLL" button generates quite a bit of output!

### Loop filter
The tool's Python backend computes the values of the loop filter components, given the input parameters.

### Loop response transfer functions
I used Python's numpy module to compute several loop transfer functions. I used [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart) on the front end to plot them.

### Noise
I used Python's numpy module to compute the PLL contributions to the output noise of the various components (VCO, charge pump, and the rest of the lot), as well as the total output noise. I used [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart) to plot them.

### Noise sources file
The noise sources spreadsheet can be [downloaded](http://localhost:10080/download/noiseSources), modified, and uploaded so it can be used in the PLL noise computations.

The downloaded spreadheet is multi-tabbed:

![Alt](docs_images/noise_sources_multi-tabbed.jpg "Noise sources tabs")

Each tab has the (default) source noise generated by a loop component (crystal, prescaler, etc.). I got some of the noise data from data sheets and some from old designs that never went into production. Here is a snapshot of the prescaler:

To use your own noise data, plug in your noise values on the second (B) column of the spreadsheet for each of the components. The frequency points go from 100 Hz to 10 MHz and are log-spaced using numpy's [logspace](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.logspace.html), which as far as I can tell works identically to its [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/logspace.html) equivalent.

```import numpy as np
freq = np.logspace(2,8,31)```


### Phase error and jitter

The tool estimates the RMS phase and frequency errors as well as the jitter. I think I integrated the noise using [Simpson's rule for numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule), but I don't remember the details. I did this part in JavaScript. I can't remember why I didn't do it in Python.

### Time response

The tool's Python backend computes the time response to a frequency step and the values are plotted on the front end using [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart). In addition, the loop lock times and their associated tolerances are also computed.
